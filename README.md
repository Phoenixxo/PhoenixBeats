# Brief Overview

This is just a simple project I have decided to work on throughout school.

A lot of the "Big" music bots for discord seem to be getting taken down so I thought I would create my own private one for personal use. 

I am uploading this to log it, as well as to show to others that this is here as well. 

You are free to use this bot, however, anything that happens is not my responsibility. 

<div align="center"> <h1> WARNING!</h1> 

<p> This bot has many errors left to fix still and is still in an early stage! </p>
</div>
# Requirements 

Must have **Python 3.7** or higher.

There is requirements file I have setup so in the terminal all you have to run is:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
 
 ### Hope you enjoy!
